# WireFire 🔥

**`WireFire`** is an open-source, self-hosted implementation of [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) coordination server.

The aim of this project is to understand how Tailscale clients co-ordinate by re-implementing parts of the coordination server.
This project is heavily inspired by [**`headscale`**](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) and [**`ionscale`**](https://github.com/jsiebens/ionscale) 🙌

💁 This is not an official Tailscale or Tailscale Inc. project.
